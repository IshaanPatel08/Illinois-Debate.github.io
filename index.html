      <h2>What is competitive high school debate?</h2>
      <p>
        Debate is an academic sport that uses arguments to earn points and win
        rounds. All competitors receive some topics for debate about one month
        before a tournament. In the weeks leading up to a tournament, each
        school’s debate team prepares by learning everything they can about a
        topic, brainstorming arguments that could be made on each side, finding
        expert sources for support, writing speeches, and practicing by debating
        each other. Tournaments are held on Saturdays at different high schools.
        All the schools who have been preparing to debate the topic(s) will
        compete against each other at the host high school. The debaters who do
        the best job persuading their judges win awards, and schools with many
        strong debaters compete for team sweepstakes awards.

      <h2>What types of debate can I do in Illinois?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>One-versus-one (Lincoln-Douglas Debate or LD)</em>: Two students
          from different schools debate against each other, and an adult judge
          decides the winner. Topics for LD Debate pose ethical questions, so
          debaters read traditional and contemporary political philosophy in
          addition to topic-specific literature. LD Debate topics last for two
          months during the school year (September/October, November/December,
          January/February, March/April). Debaters with the most wins earn
          trophies.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Two-versus-two (Public Forum Debate or PF)</em>: Two students from
          the same school debate against two students from a different school,
          and an adult judge decides the winner. Topics for PF Debate pose
          current events questions, so debaters read recent texts from
          newspapers, magazines, and academic journals. PF topics last for two
          months at the beginning of the season and then move to a one month
          rotation (September/October, November/December, January, February,
          March, April). Debaters with the most wins earn trophies.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Two-versus-two (Policy Debate)</em>: Two students from the same
          school debate against two students from a different school, and an
          adult judge decides the winner. Policy Debate uses the same topic for
          the entire school year, so students must become experts on it.
          Debaters with the most wins earn trophies.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Congressional Debate</em>: 16-20 students form a mock House of
          Representatives in a classroom. Those debaters take turns speaking for
          and against legislation, which is proposed a month prior to the
          tournament. A student presiding officer uses Robert’s Rules of Order
          to make sure that everyone gets an equal opportunity to speak. Adult
          judges score speeches, write constructive feedback, and rank the
          debaters. The highest ranked debaters win medals and trophies. Teams
          compete for sweepstakes awards.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Pro/Con Debate Challenge</em>: Students select a topic and create
          pro and con speeches for it. They record themselves delivering their
          speeches and then upload them to a tournament website. Adult judges
          evaluate the recorded speeches on their own time and rank them.
          Pro/Con Debate Challenge is the only form of debate that does not
          require any travel to other schools. The highest ranked debaters win
          medals and trophies.
